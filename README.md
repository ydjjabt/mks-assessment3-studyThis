## Chat Client
This repository is a chat-client built by a pair of alumni from the March '13 class. They (mostly) completed their HTML/CSS user interface, but neglected to implement a couple of features. Mostly things need to be dealt with in their `setup.js` file. Go ahead and redeem the slackers by adding at least 3/4 of the features below.

This is an exercise in reading code, so expect to spend most of your time figuring out where to make changes.

**Note!** Please make comments above your changes so we can easily find them!

* [ ] Make sent messages appear in the provided chat log immediately after the server accepts it, rather than waiting for a refresh
* [ ] Clicking 'Submit' won't actually refresh messages right now. Figure out why, and fix that!
* [ ] Create an update mechanism that's timed
* [ ] Clear out the message submit area after you submit a message.
